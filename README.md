# MNIST Digit Recognition with CNN
This is my python3 code to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset implementing Tensorflow.

# Dataset
I have used the MNIST dataset in the csv format, which helped make it easier for me to implement the CNN.
The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The mnist_train.csv file contains the 60,000 training examples and labels. The mnist_test.csv contains 10,000 test examples and labels. Each row consists of 785 values: the first value is the label (a number from 0 to 9) and the remaining 784 values are the pixel values (a number from 0 to 255).

# Information
The project includes various components such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results like training history, sample predictions, confusion matrix, and class-wise accuracy. It showcases the application of deep learning techniques for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of recognizing handwritten digits.
